# Friends+Me API

Friends+Me provides API to manage your account resources such as teams, queues, posts and drafts.

The Friends+Me API allows you to build applications that interact with Friends+Me in more complex ways than the integrations we provide out of the box.

## Basics

The API consists of HTTP RPC-style functions, all of the form https://api.friendsplus.me/FUNCTION.

All functions must be called using HTTPS. Arguments can be passed as GET or POST params, or a mix. The response contains a JSON object, which will always contain a top-level boolean property `ok`, indicating success or failure. For failure results, the `error` property will contain a short machine-readable error code. In the case of problematic calls that could still be completed successfully, `ok` will be true.

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "stuff": "This is good"
}
```

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "something_bad"
}
```

Other properties are defined in the documentation for the relevant function.

### Output JSON formatting

You can add parameter `pretty` with value `true` to the request url, data output will include line breaks and indentation to make it more readable.

If set to `false` or not present, unnecessary whitespace is removed, reducing the size of the response. Defaults to `false`.

### Appending Scopes

As you make API requests, a X-OAuth-Scopes HTTP header will be returned with every response indicating which scopes the calling token currently has:

```
X-OAuth-Scopes: identity.basic,identity.email,identity.avatar
```

## API Rate Limits

### Per User or Per Application

Rate limiting of the API is primarily on a per-user basis, more accurately described, per-user limit is applied if access token is used.

Per-user limit is 200 API requests per 100 seconds.

When using application-only authentication ([oauth.*](#reference/oauth) functions), rate limits are determined globally for the entire application. This limit is considered completely separately from per-user limits.

Per-application limit is 1000 API requests per 100 seconds.

### HTTP-based APIs

Use the HTTP headers in order to understand where the application is at for a given rate limit, on the method that was just utilized. Every response contains these headers.

* `x-rate-limit-limit` - the rate limit ceiling for that given endpoint
* `x-rate-limit-remaining` - the number of requests left for the 100 second or 24 hour window
* `x-rate-limit-reset` - the remaining window before the rate limit resets, in UTC [epoch seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

For example:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Limit: 500
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 499
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1392815263

{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

If you go over these limits when using our HTTP based APIs, Friends+Me will start returning a `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` error, a `Retry-After` header containing the number of seconds until you can retry and error body:

```
HTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Limit: 500
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1392815263
Retry-After: 50

{
    ok: false,
    error: 'rate_limit',
    error_description: `Rate limit "user" exceeded, retry in 50 seconds`
}
```

### Other functionality

We reserve the right to rate limit other functionality to prevent abuse, spam, denial-of-service attacks, or other security issues. Where possible we'll return a descriptive error message, but the nature of this type of rate limiting often prevents us from providing more information.

## Pagination

### Paginating through collections

Throughout the Friends+Me platform you'll often encounter collections of things. Lists of teams. Arrays of queues.

Very few of these collections are paginated today. Instead, you're likely to receive everything in the collection. Some collections are enormous and instead of receiving all of it, you'll receive it truncated instead, for example posts.

#### Timeline functions

These functions are more positional than page oriented and allow you to navigate through time with `oldest`, `latest`, and a special `inclusive` parameter.

#### Traditional paging

These functions use some form of archaic numeric-based `page` and `count` or other limiting parameters.

## Using OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that lets your app request authorization to private details in a user's Friends+Me account without getting their password.

You'll need to [register your app](https://developers.friendsplus.me/apps) before getting started. A registered app is assigned a unique Client ID and Client Secret which will be used in the OAuth flow. The Client Secret should not be shared.

Friends+Me uses OAuth 2.0's [authorization code grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) and [refresh token grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5) to issue access tokens on behalf of users.

### Step 1 - Authorization

Your web or mobile app should redirect users to the following URL:

`https://api.friendsplus.me/oauth.authorize`

The following values should be passed as GET parameters:

+ Parameters
    + `client_id`: CLIENT_ID (string) - Your application's Client ID.
    + `scope`: admin offline (string) - The scopes which you want to request authorization for. These must be separated by a space. You can request any scopes supported by the Friends+Me API (for example, read, write, ...). Include **offline** to get a refresh token.
    + `response_type`: code (string) - Indicates to Friends+Me which OAuth 2.0 flow you want to perform. Use **code** for Authorization Code Grant Flow.
    + `redirect_uri`: https://myapp.com/callback (URL, required) - The URL to which Friends+Me will redirect the browser after authorization has been granted by the user.
    + `state`: RANDOM_STATE (string,optional) - An opaque value the clients adds to the initial request that Friends+Me includes when redirecting the back to the client. This value must be used by the client to prevent CSRF attacks.
    + `prompt` (string,optional) - prompt control.
        + **prompt=consent** will force users to provide consent, even if they have an existing user grant for that client and requested scopes.
        + **prompt=none** is a workaround to improve user experience. This will not display the login dialog or the consent dialog. In addition to that if you call /oauth.authorize from a hidden iframe and extract the new access token from the parent frame, then the user will not see the redirects happening.

### Step 2 - Token Issuing

If the user authorizes your app, Friends+Me will redirect back to your specified `redirect_uri` with a temporary `code` in a code GET parameter, as well as a `state` parameter if you provided one in the previous step. If the states don't match, the request may have been created by a third party and you should abort the process.

**Authorization codes may only be exchanged once.**

If all is well, exchange the authorization code for an access token using the oauth.access API function.

`https://api.friendsplus.me/oauth.access`

+ Parameters
    + `client_id`: CLIENT_ID (string) - Your application's Client ID.
    + `client_secret`: CLIENT_SECRET (string) - Your application's Client Secret.
    + `code`: AUTHORIZATION_CODE (string) - The Authorization Code received from the initial /oauth.authorize call.
    + `redirect_uri`: https://myapp.com/callback (string) - This is required only if it was set at the GET /oauth.authorize endpoint. The values must match.

You'll receive a JSON response containing an `access_token` and `refresh_token` (among other details):

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "access_token": "eyJ...MoQ",
    "refresh_token":"GEbRxBN...edjnXbL",
    "expires_in": 86400,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

You can then use this token to call API functions on behalf of the user. The token will continue functioning until the installing user either revokes the token and/or uninstalls your application.

### Step 2a - Denied Requests

If the user denies your request, Friends+Me redirects back to your `redirect_uri` with an `error` parameter.

`https://myapp.com/callback?error=access_denied&error_description=User%20did%20not%20authorize%20the%20request`

Applications should handle this condition appropriately.

### Tokens

Authenticate your API requests by providing a bearer token, which identifies a single user.

Tokens should be passed in all API calls as a parameter called `access_token`.

Default lifetime of access token is 1 hour.

Refresh tokens never expire and can be revoked using function oauth.revoke if necessary.

**Treat tokens with care.** Never share tokens with other users or applications. Do not publish tokens in public code repositories.

# Group oauth

## oauth.authorize [GET /oauth.authorize{?redirect_uri,state,client_id,response_type,scope,prompt}]

The authorization code grant should be very familiar if youâ€™ve ever signed into a web app using your Facebook or Google account.

To get a refresh token, you must include the `offline` scope when you initiate an authentication request through the authorize endpoint.

The client will redirect the user to the authorization server, user will be asked to login to the authorization server and approve the client.

If the user approves the client they will be redirected from the authorization server to the clientâ€™s redirect URI with the following parameters in the query string:

* **code** with the authorization code
* **state** with the state parameter sent in the original request. You should compare this value with the value stored in the userâ€™s session to ensure the authorization code obtained is in response to requests made by this client rather than another client application.

+ Parameters
    + `client_id`: `CLIENT_ID` (string, required) - Your application's Client ID.
    + `scope`: `admin offline` (string, optional) - The scopes which you want to request authorization for. These must be separated by a space. You can request any scopes supported by the Friends+Me API (for example, read, write, ...). Include **offline** to get a refresh token.
        + Default: `admin offline`
    + `response_type`: code (string, required) - Indicates to Friends+Me which OAuth 2.0 flow you want to perform. Use **code** for Authorization Code Grant Flow.
    + `redirect_uri`: `https://myapp.com/callback` (URL, required) - The URL to which Friends+Me will redirect the browser after authorization has been granted by the user.
    + `state`: `RANDOM_STATE` (string, optional) - An opaque value the clients adds to the initial request that Friends+Me includes when redirecting the back to the client. This value must be used by the client to prevent CSRF attacks.
    + `prompt` (string, optional) - prompt control.
        + **prompt=consent** will force users to provide consent, even if they have an existing user grant for that client and requested scopes.
        + **prompt=none** is a workaround to improve user experience. This will not display the login dialog or the consent dialog. In addition to that if you call /oauth.authorize from a hidden iframe and extract the new access token from the parent frame, then the user will not see the redirects happening.

## queues.history [GET /queues.history{?access_token,queue,count,inclusive,latest,oldest}]

Fetches history of published posts from a queue.

This function returns a portion of posts from the specified queue. To read the entire history for a queue, call the function with no `latest` or `oldest` arguments, and then continue paging using the instructions below.

`latest` or `oldest` arguments refer to posts completed_at timestamp;

The `posts` array up to 100 posts between `latest` and `oldest`. If there were more than 100 posts between those two points, then `has_more` will be true.

If a post has the same `completed_at` as `latest` or `oldest` it will not be included in the list, unless `inclusive` is true. This allows a client to fetch all posts in a hole in queue history, by calling queues.history with `latest` set to the oldest post they have after the hole, and `oldest` to the latest post they have before the hole. If the response includes `has_more` then the client can make another call, using the `completed_at` value of the final posts as the `latest` param to get the next page of posts.

If there are more than 100 posts between the two timestamps then the posts returned are the ones closest to `latest`. In most cases an application will want the most recent posts and will page backward from there. If `oldest` is provided but not `latest` then the posts returned are those closest to `oldest`, allowing you to page forward through history if desired.

### Expected scopes

`queues.history`

### Optional scopes

`queues`

### Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this function could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` property in the response.

| Error               | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `access_denied`     | Access denied.
| `queue_not_found`   | Requested queue not found.
| `user_not_found`    | Authentication token user not found.
| `user_inactive`     | Authentication token is for a deleted user.
| `invalid_ts_latest` | Value passed for `latest` was invalid
| `invalid_ts_oldest` | Value passed for `oldest` was invalid
| `not_authed`        | No authentication token provided.
| `invalid_auth`      | Invalid authentication token.
| `missing_arg`       | The function was not passed all required argument(s).

    + `queue`: 53ed091db33c30ef172172ef (string) - List this queue published posts or list all queues available to this user if this parameter is not set.
    + `count`: 100 (number, optional) - Number of posts to return, between 1 and 1000.
        + Default: 100

If `oldest` is provided but not `latest` then the posts returned are those closest to `oldest`, allowing you to page forward through the list if desired.

# Group drafts

## drafts.list [GET /drafts.list{?access_token,team,count,inclusive,latest,oldest}]

Fetches list of drafts.

This function returns a portion of drafts. To read the entire list, call the function with no `latest` or `oldest` arguments, and then continue paging using the instructions below.

`latest` or `oldest` arguments refer to drafts `modified` timestamp;

The `drafts` array up to 100 drafts between `latest` and `oldest`. If there were more than 100 drafts between those two points, then `has_more` will be true.

If a draft has the same `modified` as `latest` or `oldest` it will not be included in the list, unless `inclusive` is true. This allows a client to fetch all drafts in a hole, by calling drafts.list with `latest` set to the oldest draft they have after the hole, and `oldest` to the latest draft they have before the hole. If the response includes `has_more` then the client can make another call, using the `publish_at` value of the final drafts as the `latest` param to get the next page of drafts.

If there are more than 100 drafts between the two timestamps then the drafts returned are the ones closest to `latest`. In most cases an application will want the most recent drafts and will page forward from there. If `oldest` is provided but not `latest` then the drafts returned are those closest to `oldest`, allowing you to page forward through the queue if desired.

### Expected scopes

`drafts.read`

### Optional scopes

`drafts`

### Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this function could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` property in the response.
