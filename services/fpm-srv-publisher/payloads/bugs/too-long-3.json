Most people were not aware Microsoft was spending millions to wage a smear campaign against Google.  Second, they are expressing their desire to get away from purchasing anything Microsoft.  <br /><br />I suspect they&#39;ll disable the comments soon, but the first one from Ricardo is typical of many.  He says, &quot;I actually didn&#39;t know about this whole deal with Google and FTC, and as I read more about it, it became quite blatant that the whole thing was schemed by Microsoft... That&#39;s a shady move, wasting government money on a dead end investigation just to stifle competition... Anyway, now that I&#39;m aware of your practices, I won&#39;t take the bait anymore, and in my company, what has windows already, will stay as it is, and will take a look on what the competition has to offer. You lost a customer today, not by the merit of the competition, but by your practices...&quot;<br /><br /><b>Now</b> is a good time to look at your options; with cloud computing and software as a service, you can run an your entire organization without spending another dollar with Microsoft.  It&#39;s not for everyone yet, but now is time to start.",
