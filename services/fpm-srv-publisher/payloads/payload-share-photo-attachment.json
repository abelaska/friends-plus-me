      "content": "<b>Think iPhone wouldn&#39;t sell? It already is sold out</b><br /><br />In just about an hour Apple sold out all of its &quot;ship first day&quot; inventory. The only way to get one the first day now is to wait in line at the store. If you buy on the Apple.com page now you&#39;ll get yours in about two weeks.<br /><br />Like I said. Love it or hate it, this is going to be the fastest selling product in history. By far. <br /><br />By the way, I didn&#39;t get one. Verizon has me locked out of my account because I couldn&#39;t remember my password and it locked me out. Stupid me for not figuring that out. It&#39;s really lame that Verizon didn&#39;t have tech support on phone. I have to call back in the morning. I forget that not every company has <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100698655987920162334\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"100698655987920162334\">Rackspace Hosting</a></span>&#39;s 24-hour-a-day customer support on phone. Sigh.<br /><br />Before you ask, if I do wait in line for mine, it will be the Palo Alto University Avenue store. I have a box of wine that <a href=\"http://us.nakedwines.com/\" >http://us.nakedwines.com/</a> sent me and I&#39;ve been looking for a reason to share it. Might just have a wine tasting there next Thursday night. :-)",
