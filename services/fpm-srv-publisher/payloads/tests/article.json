  "content": "I keep hearing about people who think they&#39;re superior because they buy Apple products, but I never encounter them. <br /><br />I do frequently encounter people who think they&#39;re superior because they <i>don&#39;t</i> buy Apple products. They brag about how Apple users are brainwashed, but they (the unbrainwashed few) are superior enough to think for themselves. <br /><br />These wonderful evolved self-thinkers all sound alike. You can hear them for yourselves in the comments on the article I&#39;ve linked to here. <br /><br />Apple users are no different than anyone else.  We live in a consumer culture. You are part of it if you buy, no matter what you choose to buy. Don&#39;t think you&#39;re superior to the other guy because of what you choose to buy. <br /><br />I&#39;m part of consumer culture. I bought a new teapot just before leaving on this trip, and a new iPad while on the trip. They&#39;ll be waiting for me when I&#39;m home and I&#39;m looking forward to using both every day when I&#39;m home. <br /><br />I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s wrong to hate Apple and its products. My friend +Ellis Booker won&#39;t touch them. He&#39;s a Linux and Android guy. And that&#39;s ok. <br /><br />When my MacBook Pro finally dies (probably soon -- it&#39;s four years old) my next computer will likely be a Windows machine. I&#39;m disappointed in that but it&#39;s not a big deal. And it might be fun to see what Windows has been up to in the last 7 years (I hear it&#39;s been up to no good, alas).<br /><br />\ufeff",
