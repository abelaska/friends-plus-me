      "content": "Mitt Romney&#39;s income taxes have become a major issue in the American presidential campaign. Is this just petty politics, or does it really matter? In fact, it does matter â€“ and not just for Americans.<br /><br />Romney may not be a tax evader; only a thorough investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service could reach that conclusion. But, given that the top US marginal income-tax rate is 35%, he certainly is a tax avoider on a grand scale. And, of course, the problem is not just Romney; writ large, his level of tax avoidance makes it difficult to finance the public goods without which a modern economy cannot flourish.<br /><br />But, even more important, tax avoidance on Romney&#39;s scale undermines belief in the system&#39;s fundamental fairness, and thus weakens the bonds that hold a society together.<br />Collapse this post<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics-blog/2012/sep/03/mitt-romney-tax-avoidance-society\" >http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics-blog/2012/sep/03/mitt-romney-tax-avoidance-society</a>",
